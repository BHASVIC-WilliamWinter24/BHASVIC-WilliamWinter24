# About Me

I'm Will, a Computer Science students studying my A-Levels. As of yet, I don't plan to go into industry in the tech sector; I want to go to uni to study maths, and then take it from there. 

My current project is for my coursework, a Unity platformer inspired by Metroidvania roguelites like Dead Cells and Hollow Knight. 
I don't have any personal projects of note, as my attention will be focused on making this game the best it can be.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Cannonfall**, a platformer based around jumping around with a massive cannon, and defeating robots on the way to collect a power cell for your new minifridge! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to create a game on _Unity_.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about orangutans, maths, or anything else that crosses your mind. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was born on Valentine's Day!
- ðŸ“– Hobbies: I love reading, running, and occasionally doing a bit of writing.
